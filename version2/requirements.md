Nice to have
- use ai chat to add words to list or verbs and generate an email to you for studying things
- generate a email based on summary of issues + append last weeks. you ideally want a 2 week retention period to make it stick
- Mode called "Preterite Only" where the user focuses on different verbs and using it in the preterite tense; Perhaps its a game where it flashes a verb and you say or write the preterite form in different forms like yo/tu/el etc
