# Project Details
- New Application Name: Palabrista or Aprendify
- Device Support: Mobile for quick journal entries and on-the-go studying BUT mainly focused on Web Users

### Requirements - Unstructured

**Must Haves**
- I want the ability to read my Learncraft Notes in a separate tab; Ideally the ability to search but that would be a plus not mandatory
- I want to listen to dreaming spanish but have the transcript available and ability to click on words to get definition and possibly add to the weekly study session
  - Autonomously download the audio file (ideal)
  - convert audio file to STT -> Transcript that and load it
  - alert me that a new video is available
- I want the ability to do the same with Language Reactor for a show like friends if possible
  - pull the transcript from language reactor -> study transcript and reward
- Any new words at the end of the week get a email sent to me that I can print out in a column format (MUST)
- I want a tab that generate sentences with the export function that makes it printable. If it generates sentences, it is doing that for the week. Ideally it will append to the previous week and after two weeks, the previous week sentences drop off. 


**What Made Learncraft Good/Bad**
- Good:
  - New verbs per week
  - New words and scenarios that paired with the verbs or had some kind of theme
  - supporting sentences per day and integrating more per day leading up to final sentences that had all
- BAD:
  - I didnt learn my own scenarios or could learn words that I wanted
  - I didnt have the other resources to absorb content like watching videos or movies


### Goal for New App
- Generate me new verbs to learn w/ congugations and sentences per week on Monday w/ Old verbs to i can remember what I already know
- Create a frequecy list for verbs I struggle with so it can be at the top of the week for the next week
- I want a "Preterite Only" section or something like that where I am forced to write in scenarios using specific verbs 
- New words are derivied from content I read/watch and added for current week and next; So if I read something new Thursday, it should give me sentences for this and the following week. it is always a curr_date + 13 days where I see the content
- I want to be able to write on my mobile device, study words, and sentences which means ability to define and get congugations somehow on mobile; I would also like to listen to .mp4 snippets as well but that is pushing it
- Leverage audio libros and build them into the app
  - maybe a way to take snippets from the books or even Sin Limites or other youtube videos
- Figure out if there is any shadowing opportunity within app
- Figure out activity where I can take a random content piece, translate it. Words I dont know + verbs, find any surrounding words/or associated words and verbs to increase vocabulary. This should be maybe a suggestion and i can add them to the word bank as well. Ideally those words have some kind of icon to show they are associated words so i can remove them easier
- Incorporate the why + why activity
- Some integration with Language Reactor
- Integrate Book/Content Purcahsed via Instagram somehow



Nice to have
- use ai chat to add words to list or verbs and generate an email to you for studying things
- generate a email based on summary of issues + append last weeks. you ideally want a 2 week retention period to make it stick
- Mode called "Preterite Only" where the user focuses on different verbs and using it in the preterite tense; Perhaps its a game where it flashes a verb and you say or write the preterite form in different forms like yo/tu/el etc
